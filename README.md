## Prerequisites

The analysis pipeline consists of three different resources that are best run
in dedicated virtual environments:

- [**BigFISH**](https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish), a python library to process smFISH images. It allows to detect mRNAs and centrosomes in 2D, format segmentation masks and compute spatial features at the cell-level.
    - Run the command `pip install big-fish==0.4.0` in an empty virtual environment to reproduce our python environment and run BigFISH methods.
- [**Cellpose**](http://www.cellpose.org/), a Deep Learning based approach for nuclei and cells segmentation.
    - Run the command `pip install -r requirements_cellpose.txt` in an empty virtual environment to reproduce our python environment and run Cellpose model.
- A more general environment with classic scientific libraries to perform statistical tests and plot results. We use it as a kernel for the final Ipython notebook _results.ipynb_.
    - Run the command `pip install -r requirements_notebook.txt` in an empty virtual environment to reproduce our python environment and run the _results.ipynb_ notebook.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on 2D images obtained with a Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP). In a high-throughput screening framework, the pipeline can scale to several plates and hundreds of wells. All images have four channels with dedicated purposes:
- smFISH - mRNAs detection
- Dapi - nuclei segmentation
- GFP - centrosomes detection and cells segmentation
- CellMask - cells segmentation

If you have any question relative to the image acquisition, please contact [Edouard Bertrand](mailto:edouard.bertrand@igmm.cnrs.fr) or [Adham Safieddine](mailto:safieddine.adham@gmail.com).

## Pipeline

Below, we provide a quick overview of the different steps in the analysis, and
in which environment they are performed. A more detailed description of each
step is provided in the following sections:

1. **Preprocessing** (BigFISH)
2. **Spot detection** (BigFISH)
3. **Segmentation** (Cellpose)
4. **Postprocessing** (BigFISH)
5. **Features** (BigFISH)
6. **Plot** (notebook)

If you have any question relative to the image analysis, please contact [Arthur Imbert](mailto:arthur.imbert.pro@gmail.com) or [Adham Safieddine](mailto:safieddine.adham@gmail.com) (or open an issue).

### 1. Preprocessing

Images are first renamed according to their plate, well, gene, treatment and field of view:
- bigfish_scripts/rename_images.py

To fit with the segmentation template of Cellpose, images are organized in different folders, one folder per well:
- bigfish_scripts/preprocess_nuc.py
- bigfish_scripts/preprocess_cell.py

A last script allows us to visualize all our MIPs:
- bigfish_scripts/plot_mip.py

| Dapi | smFISH | GFP | CellMask |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ![](images/dapi.png "Dapi channel") | ![](images/smfish.png "smFISH channel") |  ![](images/gfp.png "GFP channel") | ![](images/cellmask.png "CellMask channel") |

### 2. Spot detection

A first script detect mRNAs spots, decompose clustered regions and detect foci from smFISH channel:
- bigfish_scripts/detect_rna.py

A second script detect centrosomes in the GFP channel:
- bigfish_scripts/detect_centrosome.py

![](images/centrosomes.png "Detected mRNAs (left) and centrosome (right)")

### 3. Segmentation

We use the Cellpose model to segment nuclei and cells. An [**API**](http://www.cellpose.org/) is available online or the [**github repository**](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) can be clone locally. 

### 4. Postprocessing

Integer masks obtained from the segmentation are cleaned and we ensure every segmented cell match a nucleus:
- bigfish_scripts/postprocess_segmentation.py

![](images/segmentation.png "Segmentation results (untreated PCNT)")

We assign detected mRNAs and centrosomes to an unique pair of cell and nucleus:
- bigfish_scripts/extract_cell.py
- bigfish_scripts/merge_df_extraction.py

Specific plots can be saved for every segmented cell:
- bigfish_scripts/plot_extraction.py

### 5. Features

Based on the detection and segmentation results, spatial features around the centrosomes can be computed:
- bigfish_scripts/compute_features.py
- bigfish_scripts/merge_df_features.py

### 6. Plot

The .csv file provided is a cleaned version of the merged dataframe we obtain at the end of the pipeline. It allows us to directly run the notebook and build the synthetic plot:
- notebook/results.ipynb
